        Graduated master of science at the LTH nearby, and persued mastery within software development with great passion at work, spare time, conferences, and various communities in the Öresund region for more than fifteen years. I promised myself to never give up something so fun and rewarding for a carrier as a manager, but here I am... I simply couldn't turn down the opportunity to lead the finest crew of developers and testers I've had the pleasure to work with. Since two years, I'm the head of development of MVNO at Telenor A/S.<br/><br/>
        My passion hasn't faded, and I'm able to host community events at our location, so please come and visit! I still code some and participate in code reviews on a weekly basis, but my greatest efforts nowadays are within optimizing for customer and employer happiness with a toolbox filled with good stuff such as systems thinking, lean, lean startup, agile, kanban, continous delivery, and radical management.<br/><br/>
        I found the love of my life in class as a teenager, and now we're raising three boys together. I do my best to lure them into programming, math, and science and so far, so good :-)<br/><br/>
        The third pillar of my life is bicycles. I used to ride motorbikes, but these days my motto is - be the engine! I've got eight bikes, each with their specic purpose. The road bike is my main weapon of choice when it comes to racing, and 8:15 at Vätternrundan shall be shaved by 30 minutes this year!<br/><br/>
        These days, I hardly ever find the time to blog, but I tweet regularly @rosenlidholm.
